# Peering

We pariticipate in both internet emulation and the internet. The purpose of both networks is solely educational.

We believe that participation in its community is the key to understand anything. We are doing our best to follow industry best practices and concord with transparency. The purpose of Luginbash Network is to extend our knowledge to the many facets of the internet, not limited to routing, but also includes compliance, policies, finance, best practices, and legacies. We are delighted to challenge technical difficulties,  document the processes, learn from peers, and try the fancy new things. 

If you are interested, please peer with us on two different autonomous systems (AS Numbers):

* ~~AS135646 - the internet presence of the Luginbash Network~~
* AS4242423904 - the dn42 emulation of the Luginbash Network

Due to cost issues, it's not possible to peer with AS135646 for now. If you are interested in peering on the dn42, please contact peering [at] lug [dot] sh.
