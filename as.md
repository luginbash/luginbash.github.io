# Peering

We pariticipates both internet emulation and the internet. The purpose of both networks are solely educational.

We believe that participation in its community is the key to understand anything. We are doing our best to follow industry best practices and concord with transparency. The purpose of Luginbash Network is to extend our knowledge to the many faces of the internet, not limited to routing, but also includes compliance, policies, finance, best practices, and legacies. We are delighted to challenge technical difficulties,  document the processes, learn from peers, and try the fancy new things.
