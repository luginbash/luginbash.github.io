# Data Privacy

## Scope

This privacy statement explains to users the nature, extent and purpose, the collection and use of personal data by the responsible provider (The LaTeX Project, see contact page) on this website (referred to as "the offer" below).

The legal basis of data protection can be found in the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the Telemedia Act (TMG) of the Federal Republic of Germany and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union.

### Access data / Server logs

The provider (or his internet provider) collects access data on each access to the offer (so-called server log files).
The collected access data includes the retrieved Web page name or file, the date and time of access, the transferred data volume, report of successful retrieval, browser type/version, operating system of the user, referrer URL (previously visited page), IP address and the requesting provider.
The provider uses the data for statistical analysis, for the purpose of the operation, safety and optimization of the offer.
However, the provider reserves the right to check the log data later if there is reasonable suspicion of unlawful use due to concrete indications.

_The collected data is typically stored for about 2 weeks in the server logs._


### Handling of personal data

Personal information is information that will help to make a person identifiable, i.e., data that can be traced back to a person. This includes the name, email address or telephone number. However, other data such as preferences, memberships or which web pages were viewed by someone can count among personal data.

_The LaTeX Project does not collect or store personal information (with the exception of IP addresses stored in server logs) unless you explicitly share such information with us by contacting us personally via email. In that case we store the data you shared with us in order to communicate with you._


#### Comments and posts

When users leave comments or other contributions, their IP addresses are stored. This is done for the safety of the provider, in case someone writes illegal content in comments and contributions (insults, banned political propaganda, etc.). In this case, the provider may be held responsible even for the comment or post and is therefore interested in the identity of the author.

_At the current point in time the website of the LaTeX Project does not offer any comment or contribution possibilities other than contact by email. If we change this policy and offer possibilities for commentaries this section will be updated._


#### Integration of services and content of third parties

It is possible that within this online offer content from third parties such as YouTube videos, PDF documents from or graphics are integrated from other websites. This always requires that the provider of such content (hereinafter referred to as "third-party") obtains the IP address of the user. Without this IP address they could not provide the content back to the browser of the user. We have no control over the use of the IP address by the third-party, e.g., for statistical purposes.

_We try to ensure that we only link to content of reputable providers that offer adequate data protection. We have, however, no control over their use of your IP address._


#### Cookies

Cookies are small files that allow to store device specific information on the user device (PC, smartphone, etc.) They help to improve the usability of websites and thus improve the user experience (e.g., by storing session information). They also often serve to capture statistical data about the website usage that can be analyzed. Users can influence the use of cookies. Most browsers have an option that limits the storage of cookies or prevents it completely. Note, however, that the use of a website and especially the ease of use without cookies is often limited.
